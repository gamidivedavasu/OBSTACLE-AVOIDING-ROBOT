# OBSTACLE-AVOIDING-ROBOT

ABSTRACT:In today’s world robotics is a fast growing and interesting field. Robot has sufficient intelligence to cover the maximum area of provided space. It has an infrared sensor which are used to sense the obstacles coming in between the path of Robot. It will move in a particular direction and avoid the obstacle which is coming in its path. Autonomous Intelligent Robots are robots that can perform desired tasks in unstructured environments without continuous human guidance.The minimum number of gearmotor allows the walking robot to minimize the power consumption while construct a program that can produce coordination of multi-degree of freedom for the movement of the robot. Now day’s many industries are using robots due to their high level of performance and reliability and which is a great help for human beings. The OBSTACLE AVOIDING ROBOT is used for detecting obstacles and avoiding the collision. This is an autonomous robot. The design of obstacle avoidance robot requires the integration of many sensors according to their task. The obstacle detection is primary requirement of this autonomous robot.The robot gets the information from surrounding area through mounted sensors on the robot. Some sensing devices used for obstacle detection like bump sensor, infrared sensor, ultrasonic sensor etc. Ultrasonic sensor is most suitable for obstacle detection and it is of low cost and has high ranging capability.
